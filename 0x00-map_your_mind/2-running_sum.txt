Algorithm
A user will enter numbers that will be added to the sum and when a negative number 
is encountered, stop adding numbers and write out the final result

Define a function [positivesum] that accepts +ve int inputs and returns sum of the inputs
             n = []
             for i in n:
                if i >= 0:
                  continue
                #Once a -ve int is added the fn breaks and executes current summation
                else:
                  break

call positive sum and pass a list of numbers
